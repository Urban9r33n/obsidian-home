    - **Error Handling:** Logs and retries in case of network or API errors.

### **1.5.2 Real-Time Processing Engine (C++)**

- **Role:**
    - Quickly processes collected data to compare prices and detect arbitrage opportunities.
- **Implementation:**
    - Utilizes multithreading for parallel processing.
    - Employs efficient data structures and algorithms.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Data Normalization:** Converts data from each exchange to a standard format.
    - **Arbitrage Opportunity Detection:** Calculates price differences in real-time and alerts if conditions are met.

### **1.5.3 AI Prediction System (Python)**

- **Role:**
    - Analyzes market data to predict future price fluctuations and evaluate risk.
- **Implementation:**
    - Machine learning algorithms to learn patterns and communicate predictions to the C++ engine in real-time.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Data Analysis and Preprocessing:** Converts collected data into formats suitable for learning.
    - **Model Training and Prediction:** Uses time-series models (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA).
    - **Risk Management:** Adjusts trading strategies based on the predicted risk level.

### **1.5.4 Order Execution System (C++)**

- **Role:**
    - Executes trades when arbitrage opportunities are detected.
- **Implementation:**
    - Creates and manages orders via exchange APIs.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Order Creation and Submission:** Sends buy and sell orders to exchanges.
    - **Order Status Monitoring:** Verifies order completion and cancels or modifies orders as needed.
    - **Error Handling:** Analyzes and responds to order failures.

### **1.5.5 Risk Management System (Python/C++)**

- **Role:**
    - Assesses and manages trading risk to minimize losses.
- **Implementation:**
    - Performs risk analysis in Python and communicates results to the C++ engine to adjust trading strategy.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Portfolio Monitoring:** Tracks current assets and positions.
    - **Stop-Loss and Profit-Taking Settings:** Automatically closes positions when conditions are met.
    - **Risk Indicator Calculation:** Calculates metrics like Value at Risk (VaR) and maximum loss limits.
