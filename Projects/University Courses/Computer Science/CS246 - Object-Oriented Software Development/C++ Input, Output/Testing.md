## Testing
- Testing is essential element of development, and it’s an ongoing process 
	=> Ideally: First thing

## Testing Stuites
- Define what the expected behaviour is. 
- Can’t check everything: design carefully.

## Psychological Barrier;
- tester and developer should be different.

## Types of Testing
- Human Testing (PR reviews).
- Machine Testing (against selected specs).
- Black/Grey/White Box Testing 
	- (none/some/all knowledge of implementation).

## Good things to test
-  Various classes of input.
- Boundaries of valid ranges (edge cases), and corner cases.
- Use our intuition or experience, and write tests that expect failure.
- Do not test _invalid_ input, unless a behaviour has been specified.
- Make sure the program doesn’t reintroduce old bugs.

## How to Test?
[[Shell Scripts]] or [[C++ Input, Output]] program in this course
